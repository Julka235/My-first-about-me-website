# My-first-about-me-website
My first website, 2022 Feb

This repository includes all files used to create my firsta about-me website, mostly consisting of html and css files with minor js.

This project was my introduction to Web and UI/UX Development.

The repo consists of files such as: 
- html.index - the main file; defines the structure of the website and conects all the other files with itself
- styles/styles.css - defines the aesthetic of the wbsite (colours, fonts, text decorations, etc.)
- styles/normalise.css - makes the website look good on all browsers
- styles/fontawesome-all - the file from which I get the icons for my page (interests icons, social media icons, etc.)
- webfonts - includes all the fonts used on the page (downloaded from https://fonts.google.com/)
- images - inlcudes all the photos that are on the website (and probably more)
- script.js - when the screen is more narrow, makes the menu dropdown one
